# European-bank-Customer-churn-prediction

An ML application that predicts whether a customer would be leaving bank or not based on several features. An artificial neural network has been used for this classification problem.

To run the app, use anaconda environment as follows:
```
conda create --name <environemt name> python=3.8.5 pip
```
After the environment is created, head to the project directory using "cd" and run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The necessary dependencies should then be created.

Lastly, run the following:
```
python app.py
```
A "https" link should then appear in your terminal. Copy the link and paste it in your browser of choice. The app should be visible.
